## Dataset

> The datasets are load data and weather data. The datasets can be found as follows:

> - Weather Data:

## Summary of Findings

> In this project, weather and electric load data for different regions in Texas in the United States were analyzed. Three cities from Texas state were considered which are Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas. Results show that the hottest city out of them is Dallas. Furthermore, the best city for wind power investments in Texas is Dallas as well. Moreover, the weather is mostly clear in San Antonio and Dallas, and mostly cloudy in Houston. In addition to that, the north of the central region of Texas consumes more electrical energy than other regions. Also, "Temperature" is the most influential meteorological factor in predicting electric load. Therefore, temperature data is important when developing load forecasting models. Moreover, the load reaches its peak in the summer because of the air conditioning load being turned on, and the minimum load occurs when the weather is pleasant, i.e., when it is not too hot to switch on the air conditioning load or too cold to switch on the heating load.

## Key Insights for Presentation
> In the presentation, the aim was to deliver three main insights:
> 1- Best city for wind power investments in Texas is Dallas.
> 2- The most influential meteorological factor on electric load is the temperature.
> 3- The electric demand reaches its peak in the summer.
